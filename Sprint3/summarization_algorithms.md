# Summarization algorithms

There are a number of algorithms that will attempt to automate summarizing a body of text. We're going to try seven of them.

Using the [sumy library](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) in Python, we're going to summarize 70 news stories -- 10 each -- seven ways into three paragraph summaries. You are going to then evaluate those 10 stories summarized into three paragraphs seven different ways. You are going to rate them on a three point scale:

1. Can be used as a summary of the story as is.
2. Needs editing to be used as a summary.
3. Cannot be used at all.

You are going to create a data file of your summaries. Your data file must include the url, the summarization algorithm used, and the rating. An example:

We will use this to make tools that can improve a news organization's Alexa Flash Briefing.
